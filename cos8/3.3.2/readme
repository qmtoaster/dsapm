Qmail Toaster 3.3.2 (qmail-1.03-3.3.2) consists of the 3.3.1 patch with the addition SMTP DEBUG and the Qualys' reccomendation:
   - SMTP debug patch: If env variable SMTP_DEBUG is set the SMTP client/server
   - command transaction is logged from client connection to client quit command.
   - Qualys patch CVE-2005-1513 (https://www.qualys.com/2020/05/19/cve-2005-1513/remote-code-execution-qmail.txt).

Notes:
   There are 2 people in the Qmail Toaster community, myself included, who have had multiple 
   email deliveries because connections have died after email is queued but before the final
   SMTP 'quit' command. This causes the delivering host to resend the email until the transaction 
   is complete. The SMTP debug patch will track client connection commands and server responses 
   from the beginning to the end of the SMTP session.
